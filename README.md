## Instructions

This is a browser-based overhead view game (similar to Frogger) tests your click-eye coordination by using collision detection and key press event listeners.

The canvas consists of 3 "enemies" organized across a 3 row highway. This "highway" spans 5 columns. The enemies are randomly placed off canvas and race to the right at varying speeds. Use your arrow keys to dodge the bugs. They bite! Once you reach the shore untouched, you win!

## Dependencies
This project uses HTML, CSS, JS, and Google Fonts

## Technical Feats
* JavaScript's object-oriented programming features
* Event listeners to detect clicks and key presses
* DOM manipulation

## Getting Started

To get started on this project, begin by opening the `index.html` file to understand the structure of the page. Most, if not all, of the game logic resides in `js/app.js`. The app is driven by the game engine which resides in `js/engine.js`. Game resources such as images are loaded from `js/resources.js`.
